 Julia works on the code based on the talk:
  
 Talk:

 The implementation is not naive version, 
 see the implementation:
 
https://github.com/jianminchen/Object-oriented-Design/blob/master/Small%20Example%20From%20Google%20talk/ConditionalVersion.cs

  
 instead, OpNode and ValueNode are designed to bring in polymorphism. Good pratice: 
 Node (better called: AbstractNode, differentiate from Node), OpNode, ValueNode
 
 
 The blog is here to document the practice.
