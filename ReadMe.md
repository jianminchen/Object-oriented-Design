I like to list blogs I wrote related to object-oriented design here. It takes time to master object-oriented programming. Sometimes I hack and make things work first. Sometimes I spend time to learn quickyly and apply them by my best understanding.

I found very good place to study object-oriented programming for busy full time software programmers. <br>
Leetcode object-oriented programming web page is [here](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/object-oriented-design?currentPage=1&orderBy=hot&query=).<br>
Another link is [here about parking lot design](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/object-oriented-design/124739/Parking-Lot-Design-Using-OO-Design). <br>
[Another link](https://www.educative.io/collection/page/5668639101419520/5692201761767424/5770234338213888) is educative.io website object-oriented programming course. <br> 
I plan to purchase the course and then start to work on the research how to improve my knowledge on this. <br>
